  'Animated react page transition with react router 6 and framer motion'

Have you ever wanted smooth page transition in your react app ? For me, the
answer is HELL YES ! Not long ago I spent so much time on this matter and tried
so many different npm packages and different libraries, even tried to create my
own solution but I got nowhere. But lately I've started using
[framer motion](https://www.framer.com/), and realized with some short lines of
code, You can easily create awesome page transitions.

Before getting into codes, I want to further explain the issue and dive deeper
into this topic.

## Why should we use framer motion ?

The answer may not be simple but I try my best to explain it to you. It all goes
back to react components lifecycle. While a component is getting mounted (our
react pages are basically react components too), You can easily animate it using
css, because as component is getting painted on the screen, all the css will be
applied to it and everything is nice and smooth. But this is not simply the case
when the component is unmounting, look at the following diagram ðŸ‘‡

![Components lifecycle](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/lifecycle_reactjs.jpg 'Components lifecycle')

In the first three steps, we have access to the react component. As long as
component is mounted, We can animate it, update it and generally do whatever we
like, But as soon as component is unmounted (in our case, route has been changed
and page component is unmounted), react removes the component from the DOM
instantly, and there is no time for us to add exit animation to the component,
so your component will look like this ðŸ‘‡

As you can see, we have smooth animation on mount, but as soon as we press
unmount, React removes the component from the DOM and we don't get a chance to
show exit animation. Here framer motion comes to our help, with some
configuration we will be able to add smooth exit animation to our component ðŸ‘‡

Although our component is unmounted, but framer motion take in control and add
exit animation, So we don't need to worry about anything ! Now that you
understand the necessity of using framer motion, Let's get to our react project
and see everything in action.

# Start building our app

> You can access the source code of this project on
> [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-animated-page-transitions-xo5tqb)
> If you want to code along, You can use `src/starter` directory, otherwise you
> can access the final version inside `src/final`

We are going to build a simple react app with a few routes, and then animate
page transitions, here is the final form of our app ðŸ‘‡

![Final project](https://res.cloudinary.com/dakts9ect/image/upload/v1651229899/blog-images/ezgif-3-d60e03deca_mkzkwa.gif 'Final project')

Here is the quick explaination of the project structure :

- **Run the project** : open
  [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-animated-page-transitions-xo5tqb)
  and open `src/starter` directory

- **/components** : There is only one component here which is our `Navigation`,
  so we can easily change routes.

- **/pages** : `Contact`, `Home` and `About` are components which are served as
  Route elements, and each of them is wrapped with `AnimatedLayout` which is the
  component that handles page transitions later on. `AppLayout` is our global
  layout shared across all routes. We render all the routes inside `AppRoutes`
  and then import it inside `App.js`.

Now it's time to tell framer motion that we want to animate our page
transitions, We do that by opening `/pages/AppRoutes`. We must put all our
routes inside `AnimatePresence` component which will be imported from framer
motion, Your `AppRoutes` will be looked like this ðŸ‘‡

```jsx
import { Home, About, Contact, AppLayout } from '.'
import { Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'
import { AnimatePresence } from 'framer-motion'

export const AppRoutes = () => {
  return (
    <AnimatePresence>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<AppLayout />}>
          <Route index element={<Home />} />
          <Route path="contact" element={<Contact />} />
          <Route path="about" element={<About />} />
        </Route>
      </Routes>
    </AnimatePresence>
  )
}
```

But how does framer motion going to know that a route is changed to trigger the
exit animation ? The answer is easy, We import `useLocation()` from
react-router-dom, and use it as a key value on our `Routes` component, so
whenever the key value is changed, framer motion will trigger the exit
animation, here is the final form of our `AppRoutes` ðŸ‘‡

```jsx
import { Home, About, Contact, AppLayout } from '.'
import { Routes, Route, useLocation } from 'react-router-dom'
import { AnimatePresence } from 'framer-motion'

export const AppRoutes = () => {
  const location = useLocation()

  return (
    <AnimatePresence exitBeforeEnter initial={false}>
      <Routes location={location} key={location.pathname}>
        <Route path="/" element={<AppLayout />}>
          <Route index element={<Home />} />
          <Route path="contact" element={<Contact />} />
          <Route path="about" element={<About />} />
        </Route>
      </Routes>
    </AnimatePresence>
  )
}
```

You notice that we also added `exitBeforeEnter` and `initial={false}`, By using
`exitBeforeEnter`, framer motion will trigger the exit animation, and only when
exit animaiton is finished, it will trigger intro animation of the destination
route, so don't forget to add `exitBeforeEnter`.

`initial={false}` is optional and it disables the animation as users land on our
app, but as soon as they start navigating through our app, all animations will
be triggered.

> **QUICK REMINDER BEFORE YOU GO FURTHER**: Each of `Home.jsx`, `About.jsx` and
> `Contact.jsx` is wrapped with `AnimatedLayout`, This way you can easily change
> all transitions by updating a single component.

Now that we have completed our `AnimatedLayout`, it's time to create
`AnimatedLayout` component. We share this component across our pages so we can
easily animate transitions without writing repetitive codes. Initial
`AnimatedLayout` looks like this

```jsx
export const AnimatedLayout = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <div className="container">{children}</div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

it receives `children` as prop and render them inside a container, now by
animating `AnimatedLayout`, all it's children will be animated too ðŸ‘‡

```jsx
import { motion } from 'framer-motion'

export const AnimatedLayout = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <motion.div
      initial={{
        scale: 0.8,
        opacity: 0,
      }}
      animate={{
        scale: 1,
        opacity: 1,
      }}
      exit={{
        scale: 0.8,
        opacity: 0,
      }}
      transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
    >
      <div className="container">{children}</div>
    </motion.div>
  )
}
```

We imported `motion` and created a `motion.div`, which allows us to start
animating, `initial` is where your animation starts and `animate` is where your
animation ends, And finally `exit` will be triggered on component's unmount.

> Remember, all our routes are wrapped inside `AnimatePresence`, in
> `AppRoutes.jsx`. Long story short, If you want to animate components on
> `unmount`, You must wrap them inside `AnimatePresence`, otherwise it's not
> gonna work.

Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ You have successfully animated your page transitions. We've
only touched the surface of framer motion in this article, and you can build and
animate incredible stuff with framer motion. Stay safe and keep coding ðŸ”¥
